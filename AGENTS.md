## Project Description

**General Information:**
- This project implements the popular board game "Secret Hitler" as a Python package.
- It is intended for LLMs, other models such as MCTS, and people to be able to play the game.
- The design is a functional, stateful approach.
- There is an optional dependency for an MCP server.
- Keep the core game logic completely decoupled from the MCP server routing.
- This project uses Python 3.13 and the `frozendict` package to ensure strict immutability.

## Testing & Code Standards Rules

- **Strict Immutability:** Every single model must have explicit tests verifying immutability. 
   - A test that the dataclass is `@dataclass(frozen=True)` and that every field is immutable. This test should be named `test_[CLASS NAME]_immutability`. For example for the GameState class, it would be called "test_game_state_immutability".
   - A test for each free function ensuring it returns a *new* instance and does not mutate the input state. This test should be named `test_[FUNCTION_NAME]_immutability`.
- **Strict Typing:** Never use mutable collections in the models. Use `tuple` instead of `list`. Use `frozendict` instead of `dict`.
- **Execution:** Tests run via `uv run python -m unittest`.
- **Docstrings:** Every test must have a one-line, one-sentence docstring starting with a capital letter and ending with a period.
- **Zero Inline Comments:** Do not write any of your own inline comments explaining what code does.
- **Imports At Top of File:** Imports should only be performed once per file at the top of the file. Imports should never be placed in function bodies.
- **Formatting Enforcement:** Use `uv run ruff format .` and `uv run ruff check .` at the project root to ensure that code quality meets standards.

## Guidelines

**Tradeoff:** These guidelines bias toward caution over speed. For trivial tasks, use judgment.

## 1. Think Before Coding

**Don't assume. Don't hide confusion. Surface tradeoffs.**

Before implementing:
- State your assumptions explicitly. If uncertain, ask.
- If multiple interpretations exist, present them - don't pick silently.
- If a simpler approach exists, say so. Push back when warranted.
- If something is unclear, stop. Name what's confusing. Ask.

## 2. Simplicity First

**Minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.**

- No features beyond what was asked.
- No abstractions for single-use code.
- No "flexibility" or "configurability" that wasn't requested.
- No error handling for impossible scenarios.
- If you write 200 lines and it could be 50, rewrite it.

Ask yourself: "Would a senior engineer say this is overcomplicated?" If yes, simplify.

## 3. Surgical Changes

**Touch only what you must. Clean up only your own mess.**

When editing existing code:
- Don't "improve" adjacent code, comments, or formatting.
- Don't refactor things that aren't broken.
- Match existing style, even if you'd do it differently.
- If you notice unrelated dead code, mention it - don't delete it.

When your changes create orphans:
- Remove imports/variables/functions that YOUR changes made unused.
- Don't remove pre-existing dead code unless asked.

The test: Every changed line should trace directly to the user's request.

## 4. Goal-Driven Execution

**Define success criteria. Loop until verified.**

Transform tasks into verifiable goals:
- "Add validation" → "Write tests for invalid inputs, then make them pass"
- "Fix the bug" → "Write a test that reproduces it, then make it pass"
- "Refactor X" → "Ensure tests pass before and after"

For multi-step tasks, state a brief plan:
```
1. [Step] → verify: [check]
2. [Step] → verify: [check]
3. [Step] → verify: [check]
```

Strong success criteria let you loop independently. Weak criteria ("make it work") require constant clarification.

---

**These guidelines are working if:** fewer unnecessary changes in diffs, fewer rewrites due to overcomplication, and clarifying questions come before implementation rather than after mistakes.
